            We are a team of students from the Hamburg University of
            Technology. Since the foundation of our team in the year 2013, we
            are participating anually in the <i>Standard Platform League</i> of
            the RoboCup competition. The <a href="https://robocup.org/" target="_blank">RoboCup</a> is an international
            initiative with the goal of advancing research in humanoid
            robotics and artificial intelligence. Our team consists mostly of
            students who work on this project in their free time. Furthermore,
            we are one of the few teams that developed their entire framework
            from scratch.

          From the 27th to the 30th of April, the team HULKs participated in the GORE2023 to compete against some German as well as international teams. For the first time, the total number of robots per team has been increased from five to seven robots, prompting all teams to adjust their strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this season, building on the new Rust framework from last year, team HULKs plan to focus on more stability during the games. In the previous season, we were able to achieve the 5th place at RoboCup 2022 in Thailand. However, during our games our robots walked into each other and failed to get up after falling down. For this reason, we are working on a new robot detection, more stable walking, better fall and stand up motions.
        </p>

          If you want to join us for our exciting journey and see the results of our work, come see us at RoboCup 2024 in Eindhoven, Netherlands.

            <p>
            Since 2014, we are anually hosting the <i>Robotic Hamburg Open
              Workshop</i> (RoHOW).
            </p>
            <p>
            The RoHOW is an event hosted by the Hamburg University of
            Technology that serves the purpose of education and networking.
            Over 100 scientists and students from all over the world who are
            researching in the field of humanoid robotics participate in this
            event.
            </p>
            <p>
            The goal of this event is the exchange of information between
            RoboCup teams from different universities and research institutes.
            Participants have the opportunity to visit lectures and workshops,
            challenge other teams in competitions, and get in direct contact
            with each other.
