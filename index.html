            We are a team of students from the Hamburg University of
            Technology. Since the foundation of our team in the year 2013, we
            are participating anually in the <i>Standard Platform League</i> of
            the RoboCup competition. The RoboCup is a worldwide international
            initiative with the goal of advancing research in humanoid
            robotics and artificial intelligence. Our team consists mostly of
            students who work on this project in their free time. Furthermore,
            we are one of the few teams that developed their entire framework
            from scratch.

            Since 2014, we are anually hosting the <i>Robotic Hamburg Open
              Workshop</i> (RoHOW).
            </p>
            <p>
            The RoHOW is an event hosted by the Hamburg University of
            Technology that serves the purpose of education and networking.
            Over 100 scientists and students from all over the world who are
            researching in the field of humanoid robotics participate in this
            event.
            </p>
            <p>
            The goal of this event is the exchange of information between
            RoboCup teams from different universities and research institutes.
            Participants have the opportunity to visit lectures and workshops,
            challenge other teams in competitions, and get in direct contact
            with each other.
